## Introduction

Welcome to our project on forecasting international student enrollment at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, methodologies, challenges faced, and potential improvements.

## Introduction to Project

The project aims to forecast trends in international student enrollment at UIUC, providing valuable insights for strategic planning, resource allocation, and policy development. International students contribute to the cultural diversity, academic excellence, and global reputation of the university, making it essential to understand and anticipate changes in their enrollment patterns.

### Some Statistics on International Students

- **Proportion:** International students constitute a significant portion of UIUC's student body, with undergraduates comprising 14% and graduates 38%.
- **Colleges:** International students are predominantly enrolled in various colleges, with notable concentrations in:
  - **Undergraduate:** Liberal Arts & Sciences, Grainger Engineering, Gies College of Business, Division of General Studies, Fine & Applied Arts.
  - **Graduate:** Grainger Engineering, Gies College of Business, Fine & Applied Arts, Agr, Consumer, & Environmental Sciences, School of Information Sciences, among others.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to develop a reliable forecasting model capable of accurately predicting international student enrollment at UIUC. By leveraging historical data and machine learning techniques, we aim to identify trends, patterns, and factors influencing international student recruitment and retention. The insights derived from the model will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding resource allocation, recruitment strategies, and policy formulation.

## Project Overview

Our approach involves utilizing deterministic linear regression modeling to forecast international student enrollment trends. Linear regression is chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and ability to capture linear relationships between variables. By establishing a structured framework for understanding the relationship between time and enrollment data, we aim to develop a reliable forecasting model that can provide actionable insights for decision-makers at UIUC.

## Challenges and Improvements

### Challenges

- **Data Extraction:** Ensuring accurate and relevant data extraction, preprocessing, and maintenance.
- **Website Interface Development using Gradio:** Integrating Gradio for website interface development presented challenges in ensuring user-friendliness and seamless integration with the project.

### Future Research Directions

- **Dynamic Modeling:** Explore dynamic regression modeling techniques to capture time-varying relationships and adapt to changing enrollment patterns.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Investigate the potential benefits of ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting, or stacking to improve prediction accuracy and robustness, especially in cases of complex nonlinear relationships.

## Conclusion

Our project provides valuable insights into enrollment trends, strategic planning, and resource allocation strategies for international student populations at UIUC. By leveraging forecasting models and data-driven approaches, we aim to support the university's mission of fostering diversity, excellence, and global engagement in higher education.

## Real-world Application

- **Dashboard Deployment:** Deploy a web-based dashboard providing stakeholders with access to enrollment forecasting models, historical data, and scenario analyses.
- **Data Integration:** Integrate forecasting models with existing university data systems to ensure access to up-to-date student information.
- **Student Support Services:** Strengthen support services and programs tailored to the needs of international students to facilitate their academic and personal success.
- **Advocacy and Outreach:** Advocate for policies and initiatives supporting international student recruitment, retention, and success at institutional and governmental levels.
